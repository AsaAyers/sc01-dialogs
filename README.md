### Description
Dialogs are a popular plugin and commonly found in most applications.  In this screencast we'll go through integrating a jQuery UI dialog into our application.  You'll see how to create a custom region object to serve as a specialized dialog, allowing your views to easily pass configuration options to the dialog.  I'll also cover how to trigger events which control how the dialog behaves.
